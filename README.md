# Challenge DF

Challenge DF is a data science competition, run as part of Ocean Data Farming (DF). There's 1,000 OCEAN weekly available in rewards, to those who predict the price of ETH with the lowest error.

**To participate, follow: [Challenge DF Instructions](challenges/challenge-df.md)**

Challenge DF's final round is DF65 (predictions due Nov 29, 2023). After that, data scientists can compete in predicting ETH by [running predictoor bots](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md).
