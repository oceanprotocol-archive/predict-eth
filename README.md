> ⚠️ **Challenge DF is now retired**. [Details](https://blog.oceanprotocol.com/introducing-predictoor-data-farming-ad4c95f4a9aa#d8d5). From now on, data scientists can compete in predicting ETH by [running Ocean Predictoor bots](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/pdr-backend/blob/main/READMEs/predictoor.md).
