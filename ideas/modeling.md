## Modeling

This page lists feature vectors & AI/ML modeling algorithms that may improve accuracy.

### Already in
- random

### Scheduled to go in

- for predict-eth2.md: _something_ simple that is AI/ML based. Scheduled in [predict-eth#3](https://github.com/oceanprotocol/predict-eth/issues/3)

### Possible Future Features

These are for static models (vs dynamic):
 
- AR (autoregressive) feature vectors
- MA (moving average) feature vectors
- ARMA feature vectors

### Possible Future AI/ML Algorithms

Static models
- Linear regression
- Gaussian process model
- Static neural network
- [FFX](http://www.trent.st/ffx/) 

Dynamic models (directly for time series):

- Predict ETH challenge 1 winning algorithm
- Neural Networks

Other tricks:
- (add to me)
