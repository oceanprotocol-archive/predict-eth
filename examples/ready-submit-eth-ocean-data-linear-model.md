# Ready to Submit Example of Predicting ETH Price at a Given Hour

*This is an example of how a full submission looks like -- so anyone can participate and make their first submission.*

**The Mission of Ocean Protocol is democratize data.**
**This competition is part of our effort to help people understand the value of data and how to use it to their advantage.**

In this example we will focus on predicting the Ether (ETH) price at a selected hour of the day.

Remember:
-  You do not have to win, just make a good submission.
-  This competition is ongoing, you can always improve your submission in the next edition.
-  Also, have you ever considered that you might have a career in Data Science? You can even include this experience in your CV. It's a start...

Here is a full detailed explanation of what to do.

This is a basic detailed example of how a full submission looks like.

A few remarks:
- The code presented here is repetitive and does not benefit from neither Python's nor Pandas methods.
- Our purpose with this code is to present a very expressive example that everybody can understand in their first read.

Requirements:
- The code presented here and the instructions work for all operating systems.
- You need to have a Python 3.x version installed.
- There are several ways to make this code significantly shorter, more efficient and not repetitive. This code did not benefit from any of these opportunities. Our objective is to present a submission as clearly as possible for all sorts of audiences.

Our recommendations:
- Think deeply about which variables you can use to predict the price correctly -- **this is where your magic comes in!**
- If it is your first time in a competition like this, please concentrate on submitting a full and correct entry. This competition is ongoing. You will have more opportunities to level up your approach in every forthcoming edition.

Ready?, let's start! :rocket: :rocket: :rocket:

## 1. Understanding the Challenge

In this example we plan to predict the daily Binance ETH price.

In essence, what we are being ask to do is present a model.

In Data Science a model is just an equation that renders a value when some variables are submitted.

A model often looks like this:

**ETH_Price = Predictor Variable 1 + Predictor Variable 2 + ... + Predictor Variable n + Error**

So this is what is being asked. The ETH is the sum of a group of features (in Data Science variables are called features).

But... there is a catch. The error. The error affects the features and hence the prediction.

To get a good prediction we have to make the error as small as possible.

Can we do it? Let's give it a try by first gathering the data for our model.
